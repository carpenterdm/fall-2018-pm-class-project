                    <p>Augmented reality has received a lot of hype since 2008, but experts are saying 2018 will be the year AR hype becomes actual reality. In the past, AR received attention merely for existing – it allows users to lay visual data over their natural environment, edging consumers closer to dreams only realized in science fiction. When these dreams didn't translate to realistic use cases, AR enthusiasm waned. The technology advanced despite cooled opinions, and in 2015, Pokemon Go changed everything.</p>

                    <p>AR, while not having quite the same transporting effects, gets around 
                    this issue by layering its simulated elements over the real world. Through 
                    a pair of AR glasses, or a smartphone’s camera, you are able to see both 
                    the elbow-y chair and teetering lamp in front of you, and the data that 
                    overlays it. Microsoft’s apparent scepticism about VR is understandable; 
                    the company has instead focused millions of R&D dollars into AR (or, as the 
                    company prefers to term it, “mixed reality”) via its HoloLens, a see-through 
                    PC-in-a-visor that launches in November for the precise and gargantuan cost 
                    of £2,719.</p>

                 <p>Virtual reality unlike AR creates simulated, three-dimensional worlds, offering an entirely immersive experience. That capacity means VR is a great tool for advertising - imagine car commercials that can take you on a virtual joy ride, or a commercial for a tennis product which drops you into Wimbledon arena.</p>

            <p>AR presents a variety of opportunities to increase efficiency and cost savings across many areas of business logistics. This includes transportation, warehousing, and route-optimization. Shipping company DHL has already implemented smart AR glasses in some of its warehouses, where lenses display to workers the shortest route within a warehouse to locate and pick a certain item that needs to be shipping. Providing workers with more efficient ways to go about their job is one of the best ROI use cases in today's business environment.</p>

                        <p>From operating MRI equipment to performing complex surgeries, AR tech holds the potential to boost the depth and effectiveness of medical training in many areas. Students at the Cleveland Clinic at Case Western Reserve University, for example, will now learn anatomy utilizing an AR headset allowing them to delve into the human body in an interactive 3D format</p>
